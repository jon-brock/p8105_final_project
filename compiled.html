<p>Looking at the total and type of complaint shows Inwood/Washington Heights to have a much greater number of complaints compared to the rest of Manhattan, many of which are related to Noise, Heat, Water/Plumbing, and Trees (possibly because of Inwood Park). Many more complaints are made in the “safer” area of the Bronx near the VA hospital, Fordham University, and Van Cortland Park (Highbridge/Concourse, Fordham/University Heights, Kingsbridge Heights/Bedford Park). More complaints are raised in St. George/Stapleton in Staten Island than other areas because it is a more populated area of the island in addition to being the more affluent area of the island.</p>

<p>The above plot demonstrates that the highest proportion of open cases are complaints involving a tree. Air Quality and Car/Traffic are also addressed less than other complaints across all neighborhoods. Notably, Hazard Material complaints remain unaddressed in Morrisania/Crotona, Rockaway/Broad Channel and Coney Island. Depending on the neighborhood, Homeless complaints are typically left open.</p>

<p>Finally in table 4 cases with complaints that have something to do with tree, paint/plaster, and maintanance take the longest to close 11 - 12 days compared to the other compalaint cases that close with the said interquartile range of 0-9 days. Taking a look at the incomme bracket we observe that higher income brackest mostly complain about the homeless (17.2%) while the lowest income clase mostly complain about heat (20.3%) and maintanance(20.9%) comparing accross all income brackets. Furthermore we can also see that Manhattan has most of its complaints related to air quality (38.8%), hazardous material (30.3%), homeless (77.4%), and noise (30.5%) comparing across all boroughs.</p>

<h3>Aggregating data to community district and year level</h3>
<p>To examine the effect of community district level variables on total number of complaints we must first aggregate to the community district level. We are also interested in how year effects the number of complaints in each district so we group by year as well to produce complaint totals for each year and community district.</p>
<p>Once we have complaint totals, we do not want individual complaint information anymore. We select distinct year * community district observations.</p>

<h2>What neighborhood characteristics effect number and type of complaints in each community district?</h2>
<p>We conducted linear models to examine predictors of number of complaints from 2014-2018 per community district. Our three outcomes were:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Total number of complaints</li>
<li>Number of health complaints</li>
<li>Number of unresolved complaints.</li>
</ol>
<p>We looked at these categories of complaints from 2014-2018 predicted by year, and community district level variables including median income (in the 1000s), total population (in the 1000s), percent non-hispanic black and percent Hispanic. For outcomes 1 and 2 we included number of unresolved complaints as a predictor as well.</p>
<p>As we have equal complaints across borough we startified our analysis to predict number of complaints within each borough.</p>

<p><em>Comments:</em></p>
<p>In the Bronx, on average, for each additional year we see 102 more complaints in each community district, for each additional 1000 people in a CD we see 16 more complaints, and for each $1000 increase in median income we see 29 <em><em>fewer</em></em> complaints.</p>
<p>In Manhattan and Queens we see an effect on total number of complaints by number of unresolved complaints. On average, for each additional unresolved complaint people in Manhattan and Queens will have 17 and 8 more complaints respectively.</p>
<p>Based on the adjusted R-squared values, number of complaints in a CD range from 67.14% in Manhattan to 95.25% in Staten Island predicted by this combination of variables. Residuals appear to follow normal distributions.</p>

<p><em>Comments:</em></p>
<p>Complaints were determined to be health related if they were about heat, hot water, sanitary conditions, poor air quality, or hazardous materials.</p>
<p>In Manhattan and Queens we see a significant effect on total number of health related complaints by median income of the CD. On average, for each $1000 increase in median income we see -2 more health-related complaints in Manhattan 3 <em><em>fewer</em></em> health-related complaints in Queens.</p>
<p>Based on the adjusted R-squared values, number of health related complaints in a CD range from 56.84% in Brooklyn to 97.01% in Staten Island predicted by this combination of variables. The plots of the residuals indicate that future analyses should increase or adjust the predictors to better fit the data.</p>

<p><em>Comments:</em></p>
<p>A complaint was labeled unresolved if its status was not labeled as “closed”. For all boroughs but Staten Island, year is, on average, a significant predictor if number of unresolved complaints for each CD.</p>
<p>In Brooklyn and Queens we see significant effect on total number of unresolved complaints by the percent non-Hispanic Black population. On average, we see 0 and 0 more unresolved complaints for each additonal 5% increase in non-Hispanic Black population in Brooklyn and Queens respectively.</p>
<p>Based on the adjusted R-squared values, number of unresolved complaints in a CD range from 16.48% in Staten Island to 67.58% in The Bronx predicted by this combination of variables. The plots of the residuals indicate that future analyses should increase or adjust the predictors to better fit the data.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Between 2014 and 2018, approximately 22 million 311 complaints were made across the 5 boroughs in NYC. We were interested in how complaints differ by borough and community district. Based on our descriptive figures, mapped data, and linear models of NYC 311 complaint data, we see that there are a few key factors that play into how types of complaints are dispersed across the city.</p>
<p>With approximately 5000 311 complaints made everyday, a majority of which close within the week (66%), it is interesting to look into where the open complaints remain. We see that in four out of the five boroughs, race has an impact on number of unresolved complaints, where an increase in non-Hispanic Black population predicts an increase in number of unresolved complaints. In Manhattan we see the opposite effect, where an increase in non-Hispanic Black population predicts a decrease in number of unresolved complaints.</p>
<p>As the income disparity in New York City is one of the greatest in the nation, we wanted to see how median household income of a neighborhood also effected complaints. [<a href="https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/07/19/study-finds-n-y-income-disparity-greatest-in-nation" class="uri">https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/07/19/study-finds-n-y-income-disparity-greatest-in-nation</a>]. We found that community districts with higher incomes had different types of complaints than those with lower incomes. By borough we see that in The Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens, an increase in median income of a community district resulted in a decrease in total health-realted complaints. These areas are less likely to have calls related to water issues, rodents, and hazardous materials including asbestos and lead. What we do see, however, is that areas with higher incomes produce more 311 complaints about the homeless population. It is safe to assume that wealthier areas do not necessarily have more homeless residents, but that a panhandler is seen as more problematic in areas that have a greater density of wealth.</p>
<p>Ultimately we see that 311 complaints come from all over the city, regardless of community district economic or racial background, and the data is a minefield for answering niche questions about New York City life.</p>
