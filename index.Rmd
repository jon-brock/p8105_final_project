We live in one of the most expensive, as well as one of the most diverse, cities in the world. As such, there is going to be a plethora of conflict. We thought it would be an interesting research endeavor to utilize the massive 311 complaint data to see how community needs are met or unmet based on geographical and socioeconomic status within New York City.  

__Motivation__  
Gentrification is a growing problem across NYC and the US, leading to rent increases, the displacement of communities, and community conflict. We wanted to examine the differences in complaint type across the city based on demographics of community district. To do this we used NYC 311 complaint data and American Community Survey (ACS) data from 2013-2017 for community district level information.  

__Related Work__  
New York City has a lot of open source data. We were inspired by the idea of looking at the distribution of health complaints specifically related to NYC Housing Authority (NYCHA), as a large proportion of New Yorkers (1 in 15) live in public housing. However, looking at complaints of just public housing does not give an overview of the whole city, so we expanded our analysis to include the entire city. [Fact Sheet.](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nycha/downloads/pdf/NYCHA-Fact-Sheet_2019_08-01.pdf)

In class, we looked at restaurant reviews and AirBnB rentals in the borough of Manhattan by neighborhood, and we founnd neighborhood level analyses to be interesting. As Manhattan is only one part of New York City, and not even the most populated borough, we decided to look across all five boroughs and compare across the 59 community districts (12 in Manhattan, 12 in the Bronx, 18 in Brooklyn, 14 in Queens, and three in Staten Island).  

__Initial questions:__  
Our initial questions included: what is the distribution of 311 complaints in NYCHA public housing, and what proportion of them are health related compared to the rest of NYC complaints? As we shifted gears and decided to look at NYC by community district instead, our questions became: What neighborhood characteristics predict the volume of complaints, health-related complaints, and unresolved complaints.

Data Management
The data used in this project was collected from the [NYC Open Data website](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9).  Web based collection of 311 complaints was made public on 10/18/ 2011, contains information from 2010 to present, and is updated daily.  This data set contains 22M rows and counting with 41 columns that allow us to know the nature, the location, and time of the complaint, as well as which department responded to the complaint.  Given the size of the data set we used the filtering option on the website to better manage in three ways.  First, the data was filter between the years of 2014 and 2018 for each borough individually.  Subsequently, each data set was imported into R where a sample of 100k was taken from each borrow and binded into one data set for further analysis.  

American Commmunity Survey data:
We also included aggregated American Commmunity Survey (ACS) data in our analysis. The American Community Survey is conducted annually across the United States by the US Census Bureau to 3.5 million households. ACS provides annual and 5-year estimates of information by graphical region, including NYC Community Districts. We pulled population 5-year estimates (2013-2017) of total population, percent non-Hispanic White, percent non-Hispanic Black, percent Hispanic, and median income of each community district.

Stephen and Molly: 

We created an interactive map visual inspired from P8105 in-class map visualizations using the Airbnb dataset. Our map consisted of New York City 311 data combined with community income data from NYC. The primary objective of this visual was to create a map that displayed 311 complaints in NYC by complaint type. Our dataset (2014-2018) contained over 5000000 data points, which was too many data points to create an interactive map. Therefore, we restricted our sample to complaints created in 2018, and we took a random sample of 10000 of the 2018 data points. These data were grouped and colored by complaint type. The map visual includes an interactive aspect where one can click on each data point to reveal a label for the data point. The label describes the complaint type, location or neighborhood, median income, and status of the complaint (open or closed). 

__Additional analysis:__  If you undertake formal statistical analyses, describe these in detail

We conducted linear models to examine predictors of number of complaints from 2014-2018 per community district. Our three outcomes were total number of complaints, number of health complaints, and number of unresolved complaints. We looked at these categories of complaints from 2014-2018 predicted by year, borough, and community district level variables including median income (in the 1000s), total population (in the 1000s), percent non-hispanic black and percent Hispanic. For total number of complaints and health complaints we included number of unresolved complaints as a predictor as well. 


__Discussion:__ What were your findings? Are they what you expect? What insights into the data can you make?
