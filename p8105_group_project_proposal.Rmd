#### Motivation for the Project  

We want to assess whether or not there is evidence to support the hypothesis that as the population gets more white, do housing conditions end up improving? During times where one population is rising and another is decreasing, is there a difference in 311 complaints?  

***

#### Intended Final Products  

1. Describe the distribution of 311 complaints with respect to differences in housing and sub-populations.  
1. Time-series analysis of 311 complaints.
