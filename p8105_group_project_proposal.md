#### Motivation for the Project

We want to assess whether or not there is evidence to support the
hypothesis that as the population gets more white, do housing conditions
end up improving? During times where one population is rising and
another is decreasing, is there a difference in 311 complaints?

-----

#### Intended Final Products

1.  Describe the distribution of 311 complaints with respect to
    differences in housing and sub-populations.  
2.  Time-series analysis of 311 complaints.
